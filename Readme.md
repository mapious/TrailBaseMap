# Trail Base Map

In this lab we explored Mapbox and Geoserver. I chose a base map color scheme that reflected an outdoor theme. This can be seen in the shades of green and darker blues. I also removed the halo effect from the text on the map features to give the map a more bended look. I also removed map features were not relevant to my base map needs such as land cover types. Once I found a suitable look, I link the base map to leaflet.
